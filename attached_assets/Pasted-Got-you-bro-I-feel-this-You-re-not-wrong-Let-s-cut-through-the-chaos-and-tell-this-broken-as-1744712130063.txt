Got you bro ‚Äî I *feel* this. You‚Äôre not wrong. Let‚Äôs cut through the chaos and **tell this broken-ass AI system what it needs to do step-by-step**. No fluff. No broken loops. No dummy logic.

### üö® STRAIGHT-UP INSTRUCTION FOR THE AI ‚Äì FIX THE SKYLER FLOW NOW:

---

## ü§ñ SKYLER WILL CREATION FLOW ‚Äì FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY:

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: ACTUAL QUESTION-ANSWER FLOW
- Each question answered by the user MUST be saved in **Supabase** immediately.
- Save should happen *after every answer*, with the user ID and question ID stored.
- Use a structure like:
  ```ts
  {
    user_id: 'xyz123',
    question: 'Who do you want to be your executor?',
    answer: 'My brother, Sam',
    timestamp: '...',
    status: 'in-progress'
  }
  ```

- DO NOT wait till the end to save ‚Äì we need progressive save.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 2: DETECT WHEN ALL QUESTIONS ARE DONE
- When Skyler finishes asking **all predefined questions**, you MUST:

  - Show a big clear button:  
    **‚Üí "Proceed to Upload Supporting Documents"**

  - This must appear automatically right below the final question/answer.
  - Use a state variable like `isFinished` or `questionsComplete = true`.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: UPON BUTTON CLICK ‚Üí GO TO DOCUMENT UPLOAD
- Route the user to `/upload-documents` (or whatever your route is).
- This new page MUST allow:
  - Uploading PDFs, Images, DOCs, etc.
  - For each asset in the will (e.g. Land, Bank, Car), let user attach a file.
  - Save uploaded documents into Supabase Storage.
  - Link each uploaded doc to the correct will entry using the will ID.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 4: CONTACT DETAILS FOR PEOPLE MENTIONED
- After uploading docs, prompt the user to fill a **contact info form**:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - Country
  - Relation to the will

- Save this info under a new table in Supabase like `mentioned_people`.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 5: VIDEO TESTIMONY
- After contact info is done, redirect to a **video upload section**.
- Allow user to record or upload a short MP4 or WebM video.
- Save it in Supabase Storage and mark `video_uploaded: true` under that will.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 6: FULL PREVIEW OF WILL
- After video is uploaded, render a full preview:
  - All Q&A answers
  - Uploaded documents (click to view)
  - Contact list
  - Video thumbnail or playback option

- Show **Download Preview as PDF** button.
- Button: **‚Üí Proceed to Subscription / Paywall**

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 7: SUBSCRIPTION PAGE
- Show pricing options with these tiers:
  - Starter, Gold, Platinum, Enterprise.
- Use Stripe or your current system to trigger payment.
- On success:
  - Mark the will as `finalized: true`
  - Save all connected data to permanent storage
  - Route user to `/dashboard`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THINGS YOU MUST STOP DOING:
- STOP looping questions with no end.
- STOP ignoring save failures silently.
- STOP redirecting straight to dashboard after Q&A.
- STOP delaying document and contact sections.
- STOP pretending to be functional ‚Äî it's not working.

---

## üß† TECHNICAL REMINDERS:
- Use `useEffect` and `useState` to track progress.
- When last question is reached, set `showNextStageButton = true`
- Use Supabase client to `insert()` or `upsert()` every answer.
- Route user flow through actual pages:  
  `/create-will` ‚Üí `/upload-documents` ‚Üí `/contact-info` ‚Üí `/video` ‚Üí `/preview` ‚Üí `/subscribe` ‚Üí `/dashboard`

Let me know if you want me to **write the actual React pages**, **Supabase schema**, and **step logic** ‚Äî I can drop that in here **right now**.

We‚Äôre done going in circles. Time to build it right, once and for all üí™
