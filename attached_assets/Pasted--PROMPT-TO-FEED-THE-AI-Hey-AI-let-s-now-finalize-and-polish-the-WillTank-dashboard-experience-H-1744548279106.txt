✅ PROMPT TO FEED THE AI:
"Hey AI, let's now finalize and polish the WillTank dashboard experience. Here's exactly what needs to happen to ensure a seamless and professional user experience across the entire platform:"

🧼 CLEAN DASHBOARD (NO DUMMY DATA)
Remove all dummy stats, placeholders, fake cards, or fake charts from the main dashboard.

All metrics, such as:

Number of Wills created

Number of Documents uploaded

Number of Video Recordings

Last will created

Subscription status

Account progress

Any quick action buttons

...should pull live data from the real connected database.

Ensure all data is specific to the logged-in user (based on their Clerk ID or auth session).

If there's no data yet, show a classy empty state with a helpful message and a call-to-action like “Create your first will.”

📁 MY WILLS PAGE
Should list only the wills created by the logged-in user.

Each will entry should include:

Will Title

Date Created

Status (Completed, Draft, etc.)

Actions: Preview, Edit, Delete, Download

Clicking Preview opens the professional PDF preview with the watermark and logo.

Add a button: “+ Create New Will” that starts the AI-powered will creation flow.

📄 DOCUMENTS PAGE
Should show a real list of uploaded documents tied to the user's wills.

Each item includes:

Document Name

Linked Will

Date Uploaded

Download / View button

Allow users to upload new documents and associate them with specific wills.

🎥 VIDEO PAGE
Must show only videos recorded by the user.

Fix the saving mechanism so videos:

Are saved to the cloud (Supabase storage or similar)

Are not downloaded directly to the user’s machine

Can be streamed or downloaded inside the dashboard

Include: video title, date recorded, duration, and play/download buttons.

🧭 SIDEBAR FUNCTIONALITY
Every page listed in the sidebar should:

Pull live data and reflect the logged-in user's records

Show polished layout using the WillTank color scheme and design system

Not have any placeholder text, buttons, or icons

🎨 THEME & DESIGN
Make sure the WillTank theme is consistent across:

Colors

Fonts

Icons

Shadows, rounded corners, modern spacing

Ensure Skyler is accessible from the dashboard too — floating button or side chat, ready to assist with questions or actions.

🛠 INTEGRITY & STABILITY
Do not break any existing features.

Ensure all actions like:

Deleting a will

Editing a document

Previewing videos

Uploading assets

Starting a new will

...work without any crashes, lag, or broken UI.

📡 BONUS (OPTIONAL):
Add small toast notifications or status bars to confirm actions (e.g., “Will successfully deleted”, “Video uploaded”, etc.)

Make all pages fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
