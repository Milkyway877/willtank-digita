You got it, partner. This prompt is going to be a **masterstroke** — clear, specific, fully loaded, and aimed straight at the AI assistant/system so there’s **no room for misunderstanding** or sloppy implementation.

Here’s your **full-blown prompt** — direct, technical, and bulletproof:

---

## 🚨 AI INSTRUCTIONS — IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY & COMPLETELY:

You are now instructed to make the following critical system-wide upgrades and bugfixes to the **WillTank** platform.  
**Do not break or alter existing working features or designs**, and **do not create any placeholder, dummy data, or incomplete UI.**  
You must work strictly within the existing design and structure unless otherwise specified.

### ✅ 1. 🔗 COMPLETE WILL DOWNLOAD WITH ATTACHMENTS
- When a user clicks **Download Will**, the following should be included in a **single downloadable ZIP** or **PDF package**:
  - The final will document (PDF or DOCX).
  - All uploaded supporting documents (images, PDFs, etc.).
  - The recorded video testimony (in `.webm` or converted `.mp4` format).
- The zip should have a clear folder structure:
  ```
  /WillPackage/
    - will_document.pdf
    - documents/
        - document1.jpg
        - document2.pdf
    - video_testimony.webm
  ```

### ✅ 2. 🎥 VIDEO TESTIMONY DASHBOARD PAGE
- On the **Dashboard Sidebar**, the **"Video Testimony"** page must:
  - Display all video testimonies linked to created wills (even if the user has more than one will).
  - Each video should show:
    - Will title
    - Date recorded
    - Option to preview
    - **Delete** button
- When **Delete** is pressed:
  - Show a **warning modal**:  
    _“Are you sure? Deleting this video testimony means you will need to re-record and re-attach a new one for this will.”_
  - If user confirms, delete video from storage and unlink from the will.
- Include a **"Record New Video"** button:
  - Prompt user to select the will they want to attach the video to.
  - If a video is already attached, ask:
    > “Would you like to replace the existing video for this will?”

### ✅ 3. 🧠 ABANDONED WILL CREATION HANDLING
- If a user **abandons will creation** mid-way:
  - Track and store their progress **step-by-step**.
  - When they return to the platform:
    - Show a notification/banner:
      > “You have an unfinished will. Would you like to continue from where you left off?”
    - Clicking “Continue” resumes at the last completed step.
    - Include a “Discard” option to delete the draft and start fresh.

### ✅ 4. 📂 VIEW WILL DETAILS PAGE
- On **"My Wills"** page:
  - If the user has multiple wills, display them in a **card layout**:
    - Each card should show:
      - Will title
      - Creation date
      - Short status (Completed / Draft)
      - View button
  - Clicking **View** shows:
    - Will document preview
    - All attached documents (with download options)
    - Linked video testimony
    - Option to **Download Entire Package**
    - Option to **Edit**, **Delete**, or **Duplicate** this will

### ✅ 5. 🧾 USER SETTINGS & ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Implement the following user actions from the **Profile/Settings** page and ensure all are functional:
- ✅ Delete account (with confirmation and irreversible warning)
- ✅ Change/update:
  - Billing plan (if plans exist)
  - Email address
  - Password
  - Physical address / name info
- ✅ These forms must:
  - Validate inputs
  - Show success/error messages
  - Require user password confirmation where needed

---

### 🛑 IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Do not break existing authentication or onboarding logic.
- Do not reintroduce onboarding to returning users.
- Do not introduce any new design that has not been approved.
- Ensure all buttons and links are fully functional and tested.
- Do not use console.log for final production code — use toast messages or UI indicators.

---

### 🚀 BONUS - OPTIONAL SUGGESTION:
If feasible, implement **soft deletion** (archiving) before permanent deletion of wills or videos, so users can restore them within 7 days. Let the user choose "Recover" or "Permanently Delete".

---

**→ Begin implementation now. No placeholders. No dummy buttons. No broken flows.  
Only clean, real, tested functionality with proper error handling, notifications, and polish.**  
Confirm each change by testing it from a user perspective. Let’s make history. 🛠️🔥
