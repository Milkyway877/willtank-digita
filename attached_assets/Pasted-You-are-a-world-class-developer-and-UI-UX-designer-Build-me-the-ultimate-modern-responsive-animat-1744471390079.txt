You are a world-class developer and UI/UX designer. Build me the ultimate modern, responsive, animated landing page for a platform called **WillTank** ‚Äì a futuristic tool that lets users create, store, and deliver their wills with AI guidance.

   - Users can upload documents, record videos, choose executors and beneficiaries, and complete the entire process in one seamless chat interface.
   - The platform is accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile and focuses on simplicity, security, and futuristic elegance.
   - The vibe is similar to Stripe.com: clean, animated, modern, and trust-inducing.

2. **Design & Style**:
   - Hero section must be 2-sided:
     - Left: Bold heading, subheading, CTA buttons.

   - Smooth rainbow gradient slow animated **background** (like a floating aurora effect).
   - Smooth scroll navigation.

üîÅ Output format:
‚Üí Full working HTML + CSS + JavaScript (React or Vanilla preferred)
‚Üí Include Lottie animation via CDN or use animated SVG
‚Üí If React: use Tailwind + Framer Motion + simple file structure

üéØ Final Notes:
This is not a placeholder mockup ‚Äî it's the actual front-facing homepage of WillTank. It must be fast, beautiful, and functional, with working internal links and gorgeous smooth transitions. Think Stripe, Linear, and Notion vibes combined. Use best practices and make it easy to expand into a full PWA.

Deliver a masterpiece.
