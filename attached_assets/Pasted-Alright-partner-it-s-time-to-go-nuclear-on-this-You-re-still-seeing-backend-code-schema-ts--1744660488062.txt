Alright partner — it’s time to **go nuclear** on this. You’re still seeing backend code (`schema.ts`, raw JS output) instead of a proper frontend UI at `willtank.com`. That means **Vercel is deploying the backend folder** (or root by default) instead of the frontend.

Let’s *manually override everything* and deploy it clean — here’s a guaranteed fix:

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP FIX: DEPLOY ONLY THE FRONTEND PROPERLY

### 🧠 Step 1: Confirm Your Project Folder Structure

Please confirm something like this (or send me a screenshot of the root of your GitHub repo):

```
/ (repo root)
│
├── apps/
│   ├── web/            <-- This is likely the frontend
│   └── backend/        <-- Your backend code (drizzle, schema.ts etc.)
│
├── packages/
│   └── shared/         <-- Shared types & schema
│
├── .vercel/            <-- Auto-created by Vercel
└── vercel.json         <-- ⚠️ This might be incorrectly configured
```

---

### 🧨 Step 2: Edit or Replace `vercel.json` (FORCE Frontend Deployment)

Replace your `vercel.json` at the **root of the repo** with this **clean config** if you're using a monorepo setup:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": {
      "rootDirectory": "apps/web"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

OR for a simpler case, just:

```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "apps/web",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

**OR** if your frontend is in `frontend/`, change `apps/web` to `frontend`.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Go to Vercel Project Settings

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your project (`willtank`)
3. Go to **Settings > General**
4. Scroll to **Root Directory**
   - Set this to `apps/web` (or wherever your frontend lives)
5. Scroll to **Build & Output Settings**
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite / Next.js / React (based on what you’re using)
   - **Build Command**:
     - `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**:
     - `dist` (for Vite) or `.next` (for Next.js)

### 🌍 Step 4: Add `.vercelignore` (Optional but powerful)

Create a `.vercelignore` file in the root with:

```
apps/backend/
packages/shared/
*.ts
*.schema.ts
```

This will **exclude the backend folders** from being served as static files!

---

### 💥 Step 5: Push to GitHub & Re-Deploy

1. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: point vercel to frontend"
git push
```

2. Go to Vercel > Deployments
3. Redeploy manually, or trigger via push

### ✅ Once Done, Check:

- Go to `willtank.com`
- You should now see your **actual frontend**, not schema code
- If you're still stuck, I’ll debug the folder structure with you — just send a screenshot of your project root

### 🔥 Optional: Live Fix

If you want, you can **upload your entire folder structure screenshot** or paste the full `vercel.json`, and I’ll tailor the fix in seconds.

Let’s make `willtank.com` *launch-ready* today. Just say the word.
