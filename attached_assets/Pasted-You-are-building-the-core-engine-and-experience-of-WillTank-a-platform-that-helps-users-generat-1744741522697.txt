You are building the **core engine and experience of WillTank**, a platform that helps users generate legally-structured wills through an **AI-powered assistant called Skyler**.

Read carefully and execute with perfection:

## 👩‍⚖️ SKYLER IS THE HEART OF WILLTANK

Skyler is NOT just a chatbot. Skyler IS the **will creation engine**.

A user **must** speak to Skyler to create a valid will.

Do NOT skip this.

---

## 💬 SKYLER MUST:

1. **Greet the user** warmly when Will creation begins.
   - Example: “Hi, I’m Skyler, your personal will assistant. I’ll guide you step-by-step. Let’s get started.”

2. **Ask questions one by one**, dynamically generated based on the **template the user selected**.
   - Templates can include:
     - Will for Parents
     - Will for Business Owners
     - Will for Guardianship
     - etc.

3. **Each template has its own set of unique questions.**
   - Skyler must adjust the flow and questions accordingly.
   - DO NOT use a generic template for all.

4. The chat interface must look and behave **exactly like ChatGPT**:
   - Clear message bubbles
   - Typing animation
   - Only one message box at bottom
   - After each answer, auto-scrolls to next question
   - No side buttons, no clutter

5. Skyler auto-saves each response as it comes in, linked to a `will_id` and the user’s session.

---

## 🧠 AFTER ALL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED:

Skyler displays a friendly button:
➡️ **“Preview Will”**

When clicked:
- Skyler generates a **realistic-looking** preview of the will, using a PDF-styled layout.
- The preview should:
  - Include Skyler’s formatted interpretation of the user’s answers
  - Look professional: letterhead, logo, watermark (WillTank), document styling
  - Show roles like beneficiaries, guardians, executors clearly

---

## 🧾 SKYLER ALSO HANDLES NEXT STEPS IN ORDER:

Once user is happy with the preview:

1. Skyler prompts:
   ➡️ “Press **Generate Will** to proceed”

2. Once will is generated, Skyler says:
   ✅ “Great! Let’s upload supporting documents now”

3. The user is taken to a **document upload page**, linked directly to the `will_id`.
   - User must upload:
     - Photos of ID
     - Property documents
     - Any other supporting asset files
   - Use packages like `react-dropzone`, `supabase.storage`, or `filepond` for this.

4. After documents:
   - Auto-redirect to **Contacts Page**:
     - All people added in the will should appear here (beneficiaries, executors, guardians, etc.)
     - User **must** provide:
       - Email
       - Phone
       - Location
     - All contacts must be saved in `contacts` table with correct `will_id`

5. After contacts:
   - Go to **Video Recording Page**
     - User records a video of themselves giving a will statement
     - Use `react-webcam`, `MediaRecorder`, or `ffmpeg` to record
     - Small webcam preview + guidelines of what to say
     - Save video under `videos` table linked to `will_id`

6. Finally:
   - Take user to **Final Will Preview**
     - Combine Q&A → full will
     - Display all linked documents (with view/download)
     - Show contact list
     - Embed video
     - Everything styled like a real legal will
     - PDF layout, date, watermark “WillTank”, logo, elegant serif fonts

   - Skyler prompts:
     ➡️ “If you’re satisfied, press **Finalize Will**”

7. Then → **Plan Selection Page**
   - Stripe plans: Starter, Gold, Platinum, Enterprise
   - Upon payment success:
     - Will is locked
     - Show message: 🎉 “Congratulations! Your Will has been successfully created.”
     - Redirect to Dashboard where they see all Wills stored.

## 🧠 IMPORTANT RULES FOR SKYLER + AI:

- **DO NOT SKIP SKYLER.** No user should create a will manually. It must be done via Skyler chat.
- **DO NOT mix templates.** Each template = different Skyler flow.
- **DO NOT confuse user with multiple buttons or UI noise.** Just like ChatGPT — clean, clear, focused.
- Skyler = guide, friend, lawyer, validator, and memory keeper. She saves everything quietly and seamlessly.
- Skyler must give users confidence that they’re doing things the right way.

## 🧱 REQUIRED STACKS & PACKAGES (React-based):

- Chat UI: `react-chat-ui`, `tailwind`, or custom ChatGPT-like interface
- Auto-scroll: `useRef`, `scrollIntoView`, `IntersectionObserver`
- Auto-save: `debounced useEffect`, `supabase.from(...).upsert()`
- PDF Will generation: `pdf-lib`, `html2pdf.js`, `@react-pdf/renderer`
