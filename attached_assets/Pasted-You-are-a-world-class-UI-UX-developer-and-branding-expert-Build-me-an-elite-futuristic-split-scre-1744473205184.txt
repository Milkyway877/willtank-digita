You are a world-class UI/UX developer and branding expert. Build me an elite, futuristic, split-screen authentication system for a platform called **WillTank** — a smart, AI-powered tool for will creation, storage, and secure delivery.

📌 PROJECT CONTEXT:
- WillTank helps users create and deliver legally sound wills with the help of a smart AI assistant named **Skyler**.
- The platform is secure, elegant, futuristic, and trustworthy.
- The UI should reflect innovation, peace of mind, and digital security.

🎯 AUTH SCREENS TO DESIGN:
- Sign In
- Sign Up
- Forgot Password
- Reset Password
- Optional: OTP Verification or Magic Link (if time permits)

🧩 DESIGN STYLE:
- Split-screen layout:
  - **Left Side (Brand Panel):**
    - Logo + branding + tagline
    - Brief summary of what WillTank does
    - Skyler AI illustration or Lottie animation
    - A powerful quote or advice line (e.g., “Legacy isn’t just what you leave, but how you leave it.”)
    - Dark elegant background with animated gradient (aurora-like, slow rainbow wave)
  - **Right Side (Form Panel):**
    - Form with full validations (Email, Password, etc.)
    - Toggle between Sign In / Sign Up
    - Subtle form animations (fields slide in or fade)
    - Smooth hover effects, shadows, floating labels
    - CTA buttons should glow subtly and be magnetic
    - Include "Continue with Google" button (styled)
    - Mobile-first design: collapses into stacked view

📌 FUNCTIONALITY:
- Responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Validates inputs, shows error states, and success animations
- Uses clean and semantic HTML/CSS or Tailwind CSS
- Animations via Framer Motion or similar
- Password visibility toggle, “Remember me” checkbox
- Links to Terms & Privacy
- Optional loading animation while authenticating

🎨 VISUAL TOUCHES:
- Use a beautiful custom font like Sora, Inter, or Space Grotesk
- Brand colors: subtle purples, deep blues, with white and rainbow gradients
- Add small, elegant animated particles or starfield on the brand side
- Use radial glow or blur effects for depth
- Subtle background glassmorphism or frosted panel

🧱 TECH STACK PREFERENCE (if applicable):
- React + Tailwind CSS (ideal)
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS also okay if React not possible
- Use modular design so each auth screen is reusable
- Add helper components for Input, Button, etc.

📂 OUTPUT FORMAT:
→ Full authentication layout (all screens)
→ Ready-to-use pages (sign-in, sign-up, forgot password, reset)
→ Minimal external dependencies
→ Beautifully structured code (components, styles, animations)

🏆 GOAL:
This is not just auth. This is a **statement** — it’s the first thing a user sees before entering WillTank. It must **feel like the future**, build **trust**, and be **legendary** in visual and functional design.

Deliver brilliance.
