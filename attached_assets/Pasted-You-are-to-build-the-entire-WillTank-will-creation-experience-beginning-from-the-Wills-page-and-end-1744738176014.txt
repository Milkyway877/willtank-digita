You are to build the entire WillTank will creation experience, beginning from the Wills page and ending at the final congratulatory screen after a valid will is generated.

This must be a **seamless, beautiful, fully functional multi-stage flow** — NOT a placeholder or mockup.

## 🧾 PAGE 1: WILLS PAGE – pages/Wills.jsx

A modern, beautiful page that shows all saved wills for the user.

### Top Button:
- Label: `Create New Will`

- For each will, show:
  - Title
  - Created At
  - Last Updated
- Buttons:
  - `Preview` → opens full will in readable modal
  - `Edit` → reopens chat flow with saved data
  - `Download` → generates real PDF using `pdf-lib` or `html2pdf.js`

## 🤖 SKYLER CHAT SECTION

- Ask questions like:
  - Full name
  - Marital status
  - Do you have children?
  - Assets?
  - Executors?
  - Beneficiaries?

### UI Rules:
- Only show a message bubble + 1 input field + send button
- After each answer:
  - Auto-scroll upward
  - Display next question from Skyler
- No other buttons visible

### Data:
- Store answers progressively (in Supabase or local state)
- Detect when all questions are done, and show a `Preview Will` button

## 🧾 PREVIEW WILL (Step 1)

## 📥 DOCUMENT UPLOAD SECTION (Step 2)

User is prompted to upload files to support the will:

Once done: Button – `Proceed`

## 👥 CONTACTS PAGE (Step 3)

- For each name:
  - Show form fields:
    - Email
    - Phone Number
    - Country/Location

Button: `Proceed`

Store all contact data properly in the backend.

## 📹 VIDEO RECORDING PAGE (Step 4)

User records a video testimony to support authenticity:

### UI:
- Small camera preview window (user sees themselves)
- Side instructions:
  - What to say in the video
  - “State your name, date, confirm the will is yours…”

### Functionality:
- Use `react-webcam` for camera feed
- Record using `mediaRecorder`
- Save video to Supabase Storage / S3
- Button: `Proceed`

### 🧠 FINAL NOTES:

- Do NOT leave any broken buttons or dummy flows.
- Each button and stage must be real and connected.
- Every answer must be saved and retrieved properly.
- Skyler chat must NOT loop, freeze, or skip stages.
- User cannot skip stages unless flow allows it.
- No placeholder modals. Everything is 100% real and working.

This is a full product. You are to **build the real working version**, not mockups. Deliver each page, component, and hook cleanly and modularly.
