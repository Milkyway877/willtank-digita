## 🔐 FINAL AUTH & ONBOARDING SYSTEM REWRITE — FULL INSTRUCTIONS

### 🧠 TO THE AI/DEV SYSTEM:
You are to **completely remove the current broken authentication and onboarding system** and implement a **clean, secure, and user-friendly flow** based on the following detailed spec.  
You must **NOT break** or **modify** any other part of the platform.  
This change must be **self-contained**, functional, secure, and visually consistent with the rest of the WillTank platform.

## ✅ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM (Full Rewrite)

### ✨ Pages to Create/Replace:
1. **Sign Up Page**

## 🚀 AUTH FLOW LOGIC:

1. **New User Signup Flow**
   - ✅ User signs up with email & password
   - ✅ User is redirected to **Email Confirmation Page**
   - ✅ User receives email with confirmation code or link
   - ✅ After confirmation, user is redirected to:
     1. **Smooth Onboarding Experience**
     2. **Paywall (if applicable)**
     3. **Congratulations page**
     4. **Template selection**
     5. **Will creation steps** (unchanged)
   - ✅ Once user finishes the will process, they’re redirected to **Dashboard**

2. **Returning User Login**
   - ✅ If user logs in successfully and is confirmed:
     - Skip all onboarding
     - Redirect **directly to Dashboard**
   - ❌ Onboarding, templates, etc. must **never** show again for returning users

---

## 🧼 ONBOARDING REWRITE:

- Replace current onboarding system with a **clean, modular step-based UI**
- Smooth transitions between steps
- All buttons functional: "Next", "Back", "Skip"
- Keep each stage focused (profile setup, optional info)
- Paywall at the end should be styled and functional
- After paywall, show congratulations message and proceed to templates

---

## 📦 Tech Requirements:
- All buttons, redirects, inputs, forms must be 100% functional
- Handle errors (e.g., invalid code, expired link) gracefully
- Use clean design: white backgrounds, minimal color accents (WillTank theme)
- No overlapping modals, broken states, or frozen buttons
- Smooth scrolling and transitions throughout the flow
- All authentication states (unauthenticated, confirming, authenticated) must be respected

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT:
- ❌ Touch or alter other pages like Dashboard, Video Testimony, or Will Creation flows
- ❌ Introduce any new design that doesn’t match the current theme
- ❌ Add any dummy components, non-functional buttons, or unfinished pages
- ❌ Leave broken buttons, form elements, or navigation issues behind

---

## ✅ FINAL NOTE:
This update must be:
- **Secure**
- **Functional**
- **Visually beautiful**
- **Polished to perfection**
- **Easy for users of all types to use smoothly and intuitively**
