Absolutely partner ‚Äî it‚Äôs go-time now that **WillTank.com is live on Vercel**! Here's your **God-Mode Production Prompt** to tell Replit AI (or your setup assistant) to configure everything for production. This will ensure **no dummy data**, **correct environment usage**, **secure API keys**, and **production-grade behavior** across the board ‚Äî all without breaking a single thing.

### ‚úÖ COPY & PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI (OR LOVABLE, VERCEL, ETC)

```
The platform is now live on https://willtank.com and deployed using Vercel. You must now configure the entire system for **PRODUCTION MODE** with the following mandatory instructions:

üîê 1. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Ensure all `.env.production` variables are used and override dev values:
  ```
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_Y2xlcmsud2lsbHRhbmsuY29tJA
  VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_jVSOIePTefpxUcaR8A1aNFJ5hfuXuGC5feZcR5nNBf
  DATABASE_URL=[Replit DB URL or connection logic]
  DOMAIN=https://willtank.com
  ```
- Do **not expose any secret keys on frontend**.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. STRIP DUMMY DATA
- Remove all dummy placeholders from:
  - Dashboard widgets (wills, videos, documents, etc)
  - Sidebar links and quick actions
  - Skyler AI interactions
  - Will preview templates and example data

‚úÖ 3. CONNECT REAL DATA
- Ensure all data across pages pulls from **live user data** via:
  - Clerk-authenticated sessions
  - Replit Database keys based on `user.id`
  - Real document, will, and video storage from actual user submissions

ü§ñ 4. SKYLER AI FINAL CONFIGURATION
- Make sure Skyler is fully integrated and uses **GPT-4o Mini API**
- Add real-time validations, suggestions, and inline help icons
- Stop using dummy "next question" logic
- Ensure Skyler reads from the live session, not mock data

üì• 5. DOCUMENT AND VIDEO STORAGE
- Save all uploaded or generated documents to persistent storage
- Ensure videos recorded during will creation:
  - Are uploaded to a bucket (or saved in base64 to Replit DB)
  - Do NOT auto-download to the user's PC
  - Are referenced correctly in the user's dashboard

üì® 6. EMAIL TRIGGERS (REAL-TIME)
- Trigger transactional emails in real-time:
  - OTP verification
  - Welcome message
  - Will completion confirmation
  - Beneficiary invites
  - Check-ins and death-confirmation logic
- Use production SMTP provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc) or Vercel's email provider
- DO NOT use any test or staging email templates

üîê 7. PRODUCTION SECURITY
- Restrict `/admin` route to:
  - `https://willtank.com/admin/login/<SECURE_STRING>`
  - Only accessible if user role is 'admin'
- Prevent any public access to:
  - Internal database endpoints
  - Server logs or secret keys

üß™ 8. EDGE FUNCTIONS SETUP (if any)
- Deploy and test Vercel Edge Functions (or Replit endpoints) used by:
  - Clerk Webhooks (user.created, user.deleted)
  - Email triggers
  - Video/document uploads
  - Admin broadcast features

üé® 9. THEME & BRANDING
- Apply the official WillTank theme site-wide:
  - Faint watermark on Will previews
  - Visible WillTank logo
  - Fonts, colors, buttons, spacing matching WillTank design system
- Do not include any dev-only styles or mock brand elements

üßº 10. FINAL POLISH & TESTING
- Ensure no console errors
- No broken links or navigation items
- All features from signup to will creation and preview are working smoothly
- All dashboard pages (My Wills, Documents, Videos) reflect live and current data
- Admin dashboard functions as intended

Final Goal: The platform must now behave like a clean, fully functional production platform with real-time data, live users, clean logic, security, and performance optimized for live usage.
