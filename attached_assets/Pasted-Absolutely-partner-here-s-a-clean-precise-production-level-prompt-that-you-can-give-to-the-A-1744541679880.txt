Absolutely partner — here's a **clean, precise, production-level prompt** that you can give to the AI or dev team to make sure:

- ✅ **Dashboard notifications are triggered correctly**
- ✅ **Emails are sent on time in real-time without delays**
- ✅ **Nothing breaks in the process**
- ✅ **No duplicate messages or spammy behavior occurs**

## 📣 PROMPT: ENABLE DASHBOARD NOTIFICATIONS + REAL-TIME EMAIL TRIGGERS

---

### ✅ GOAL

Ensure **WillTank** sends **real-time email notifications** and **clean in-app dashboard alerts** for the most important user actions. No dummy placeholders. No skips. No duplicates. All notifications must be **clear, helpful, and personalized**.

---

## 🔔 DASHBOARD NOTIFICATIONS

### ➤ LOCATION:  
- Notifications should appear in the **top bar bell icon**, with an unread badge.  
- Should persist even after page reload (store in `notifications` table).

### ➤ REQUIRED STRUCTURE:
Each notification should include:
- `title`: Short notification (e.g., "Will Saved Successfully")
- `body`: Extra detail (e.g., "Your will for John Doe has been saved and is now viewable.")
- `timestamp`: Date/time of action
- `read`: true/false (user can mark as read)
- `link`: Optional redirect (e.g., link to open that will or page)

### 🔁 TRIGGERED DASHBOARD NOTIFICATIONS (AND COPY):

| Action | Notification |
|-------|--------------|
| ✅ User completes onboarding | `Welcome to WillTank! Let's begin creating your first will.` |
| 📄 User saves a draft will | `Draft Saved – Your progress has been saved successfully.` |
| 🧠 Will submitted & completed | `Will Submitted – Your will has been finalized and stored.` |
| 🧾 New document uploaded | `Document Uploaded – Your new document is now saved.` |
| 🎥 Video recording saved | `Video Recorded – Your video message has been saved.` |
| 👤 Beneficiary added | `Beneficiary Added – [Name] has been added to your will.` |
| 💬 Skyler provides fix suggestion | `Skyler Suggested a Fix – Tap to review.` |
| 🛡️ 2FA enabled | `Two-Factor Authentication is now active on your account.` |
| 💳 Plan purchased via Stripe | `Thank You – Your [Plan] subscription is active.` |

## 📧 EMAIL TRIGGERS

### ➤ Email Settings:
- Use transactional email service (e.g., **Resend**, **SendGrid**, etc.)
- All email logic should go through verified Supabase **Edge Functions** to avoid abuse.
- Use dynamic templates (optional) and always include a fallback plain-text version.
- Do **not** send duplicates — each action should trigger only once per user.

### 🛑 PREVENTION & VALIDATION

- Emails should NOT be sent multiple times for same action (use flags in DB or logs).
- Dashboard notifications should NOT pile up for repeated actions.
- Test all webhooks and Edge Functions **individually** before deploying to production.
- Ensure **unsubscribe footer** on non-critical (optional) emails where applicable.

---

### 🧠 AI Assistant Instructions

- Do NOT use hardcoded logic or dummy delays.
- Use **Supabase Edge Functions or Webhooks** for triggering emails.
- Save all dashboard notifications to `notifications` table:
  ```sql
  id | user_id | title | body | timestamp | read | link
  ```
- Respect **user’s timezone** where needed for emails.
- Avoid sending emails for "draft saves" unless user manually opts in.
- Emails must be **instantly triggered**, not delayed or queued.

Once this is implemented, you'll have a **bulletproof alert + notification system** that’s fully reliable and matches a real-world SaaS standard. When you're ready to test emails or set up additional templates, I can help generate perfect examples too.
