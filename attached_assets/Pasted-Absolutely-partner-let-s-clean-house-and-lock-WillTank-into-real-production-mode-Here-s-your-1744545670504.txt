Absolutely, partner — let’s clean house and lock WillTank into **real production mode**. Here's your **laser-focused prompt** to hand over to the AI assistant or dev assistant. It ensures **onboarding works**, **Skyler is fully functional**, and **everything is connected to real data with no more dummy junk**. It also addresses the **video recording issue**, **document saving**, and improves how Skyler handles will creation questions.

### 🧠 FINAL CLEANUP & PRODUCTION MODE PROMPT FOR AI

**OBJECTIVE:**  
Finalize and fully activate WillTank's production logic — **no more dummy AI**, **no fake data**, and **no skipped steps**. Ensure everything is **live**, **verified**, **Skyler-powered**, and **ready for real users**.

---

### ✅ 1. 🔁 FIX ONBOARDING FLOW

- Ensure that **all new users** go through the **onboarding flow FIRST** after signing up.
- Only **after onboarding**, show the **template selection** screen.
- Save onboarding progress to Supabase or the live DB under a `user_onboarding_complete` flag.
- If `user_onboarding_complete = false`, redirect the user to the onboarding flow (not template).

---

### ✅ 2. 🧠 SKYLER MUST BE THE REAL AI IN THE WILL CREATION FLOW

- Fully **remove any placeholder, dummy, or local logic** pretending to be AI.
- Replace with **Skyler powered by GPT-4o Mini**, using this provided key:
  ```
  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
  ```

#### ✅ SKYLER FEATURES TO ACTIVATE:
- Skyler appears **during all will creation** steps.
- Every question must have an **(i) icon** beside it:
  - On click, Skyler appears with a **tooltip explanation, examples, and best practices**.
- Skyler should **evaluate the response**:
  - If it seems incorrect, confusing, or misspelled, Skyler should **suggest a fix** with:
    - ✅ Fix
    - ❌ Continue as is
- Responses should be passed through Skyler’s context before moving to the next step.
- Skyler uses full project knowledge of WillTank to assist **accurately**.

### ✅ 3. 📇 WILL CREATION FIELD REQUIREMENTS

Each will template and flow must include:

- **Full name**
- **Email**
- **Phone number**
- **Country/City/Location**
- **Relation (for each beneficiary)**
- Fields must validate correctly:
  - Email format check
  - Phone number must match international formats
  - Location should offer suggestions (if possible)

These are saved directly to the **Supabase database** in the correct table — no dummy handlers.

---

### ✅ 4. 📹 VIDEO RECORDING ISSUE — MUST BE FIXED

**Current Problem:**
- The video gets recorded and then **automatically downloaded** to the user’s device.
- The dashboard cannot preview it and shows an error because **no copy is saved to the server**.

**Fix Required:**
- On recording completion:
  - Upload the video to Supabase Storage or a media bucket (e.g., `/user_videos/{userId}/{willId}/video.mp4`)
  - Save video metadata to `videos` table linked with the `willId`
- Update the dashboard:
  - Video player fetches and streams from Supabase or media storage.
  - Remove all auto-download logic from frontend.

---

### ✅ 5. 🖼️ DOCUMENT IMAGE ISSUE

**Current Problem:**
- Upon will creation, images are shown as if saved, but they’re not found later.

**Fix Required:**
- Store all uploaded or AI-generated images (signatures, assets, etc.) to Supabase storage at:
  ```
  /user_docs/{userId}/{willId}/docname.jpg
  ```
- Update your `documents` table with:
  - `document_url`
  - `will_id`
  - `user_id`
  - `created_at`
- Ensure dashboard previews the **actual image URL**, not dummy paths.

---

### ✅ 6. 📂 NO MORE DUMMY DATA

- Replace **all mock or placeholder data** on:
  - Dashboard widgets
  - Will listings
  - Document previews
  - Skyler chat
- Ensure that **only real Supabase queries** populate everything on all pages.

---

### ✅ 7. ➕ ADD “Create New Will” BUTTON ON “My Wills” PAGE

- Prominently add a **“Create New Will”** button.
- On click:
  - User is taken back through the **template selection + will creation flow**
  - A new `willId` is generated, and everything starts fresh.

---

### ✅ 8. 🔁 CRITICAL BEHAVIOR FIXES

- Skyler should not allow users to blindly enter garbage and proceed.
- Templates must be linked to saved will instances with correct status (draft, completed).
- Users should be able to preview, edit, or download wills **after creation**.
- Add loading states where necessary and keep UX smooth.

---

### 🧠 OPTIONAL POLISH (If Time Permits)

- Save will creation as **autosave drafts** every few steps.
- Add Skyler smart suggestions like: “Do you want to add another beneficiary?” or “You missed a phone number for John Doe.”
- Add ability for Skyler to summarize the completed will in natural language before submission.

---

Once this prompt is passed, the AI or dev assistant should rebuild the WillTank flow to feel **real, professional, and seamless**, with Skyler at the heart of it all.
