You are a professional AI developer in charge of finalizing the entire WillTank post-will user dashboard system. The full frontend layout, styles, and components have already been created. Your job now is to:

üö® CORE MISSION:
Ensure that **every page, link, section, and button is fully functional** ‚Äî no placeholders, no dummy data, and no non-working links.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT:
- Create any new pages that were not requested.
- Break the existing UI/UX or animations.
- Add sample or dummy data.
- Overwrite working styles or layout logic.

---

üìå WHAT TO DO:

1. **VISIT EVERY PAGE** in the WillTank frontend:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/checkin`
   - Any components connected via `Sidebar.js` like `WillDocumentCard`, `SupportingDocuments`, `VideoSection`, `Beneficiaries`, `DeliveryInstructions`, `PlanBilling`, `Settings`, and `LiveDocPreview`

2. **ENSURE EVERY BUTTON, FORM, AND INTERACTION WORKS.**
   - Buttons should **route properly**.
   - Inputs should **save and reflect actual data**.
   - Uploads should work (use mock logic if no backend exists, but no placeholders).
   - Check if clicking "Edit Will" routes to the AI Q&A flow.
   - On `/checkin`, make sure all buttons lead to their respective pages.

3. **MAKE EACH SECTION INTERACTIVE**:
   - If a user adds a beneficiary, the form should work, save, and be visible.
   - If a user uploads a document, show the uploaded file preview or name.
   - The live preview section should reflect user answers (or show a generated template if no answers yet).

4. **LINK ALL BUTTONS AND ACTIONS TO REAL HANDLERS.**
   - Use `onClick` and `onSubmit` properly.
   - Ensure data entry saves to state or backend integration if present (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, LocalStorage).
   - Make forms functional using React hooks (e.g., useState/useEffect/useContext or useForm).

5. **CONFIRM NAVIGATION IS SMOOTH AND STATE IS MAINTAINED.**
   - When navigating from section to section, persist user data.
   - Do not reset fields unless explicitly meant to.
   - Route correctly on "Continue", "Edit", or "Finalize".

6. **ENSURE AUTHENTICITY OF ALL TEXT.**
   - No lorem ipsum, no placeholders.
   - Use real WillTank copywriting or reasonable smart defaults.
   - WelcomeBanner should greet user by name if available from auth context.

7. **DO NOT RENDER ANYTHING UNREQUESTED.**
   - Do not add blog pages, settings pages unrelated to will planning, etc.
   - Stick strictly to the WillTank process.

üì¶ TECHNOLOGIES IN USE:
- TailwindCSS
- React / Next.js
- Framer Motion
- Clerk or custom auth (if integrated)
- Optional: Supabase or Firebase (if available)

---

üõ†Ô∏è EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW:
- Buttons like `Edit My Will`, `Upload ID`, `Add Beneficiary`, and `Finalize Will` should work end-to-end
- If ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù logic exists, use a mock function that simulates uploading and shows filename or filecard
- If beneficiary data is added, it should persist via state/context/api
- If a section is marked ‚ÄúComplete,‚Äù show a checkmark or completion status

---

üî• END GOAL:
Turn the current WillTank Dashboard and Check-In system into a **fully functional, user-ready product** with real interactions, working links, fully wired buttons, and no broken UX or UI.

This should feel like a **sealed vault**, with total confidence and control.

When done, test every part to verify its stability, accuracy, and polish.
