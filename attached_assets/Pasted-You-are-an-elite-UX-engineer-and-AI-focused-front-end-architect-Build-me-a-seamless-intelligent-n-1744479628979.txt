You are an elite UX engineer and AI-focused front-end architect. Build me a seamless, intelligent, non-dashboard interface for a platform called **WillTank** — an AI-powered tool that helps users create, store, and deliver legal wills.

💡 CORE IDEA:
This is not a traditional dashboard. It’s a **single, futuristic chat-based interface** guided by our AI assistant **Skyler**, with real-time previews and smooth transitions. The user is on a journey — guided step-by-step, like a personalized will-creation ritual.

📌 OVERVIEW OF USER FLOW (Step-by-Step):

---

### 1. 📑 TEMPLATE SELECTION SCREEN

- Show a grid of will templates, each with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Icon or graphic
  - Who it’s for (e.g., “Simple Will – for individuals with minimal assets”, “Family Will – for guardians & dependents”)
- When a user selects a template:
  - The screen **auto-scrolls upward** to reveal a glowing "Continue" button with animation.
  - Clicking "Continue" begins the chat journey.

---

### 2. 💬 AI CHAT Q&A SCREEN (Skyler Chat Interface)

- The core of the platform. Mimic an AI chat interface where:
  - Skyler asks one question at a time.
  - User types or selects an answer.
  - Upon answering, the screen **auto-scrolls smoothly** to show the next question.
  - Skyler responds like a real assistant: “Great! Now let’s talk about your assets…”

#### ➕ LIVE DOCUMENT PREVIEW PANEL
- A dynamic panel on the right (desktop) or collapsible panel (mobile) that:
  - Updates in real time as user fills data
  - Shows the legal will taking shape
  - Styled like a real legal doc (signature lines, structure, serif font)
  - Show: names, assets, beneficiaries, executors, clauses, etc.

#### 📌 REQUIRED FIELD DETAILS (FOR HUMANS)
- When the user enters:
  - **Beneficiaries / Executors / Guardians / Trusted Contacts**
    - Prompt for: Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Location, Relationship
    - Validations for required fields

### 3. 📁 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS PAGE

- After the final Q&A step, show:  
  “To finalize your will, please upload your supporting documents.”
- Dynamically list document requirements based on previously answered data:
  - If assets included a car: “Upload car registration”
  - If property listed: “Upload property title deed”
  - Always ask for: National ID or Passport

- Document Upload UI:
  - Drag & drop or browse files
  - Show file type and size validations
  - Progress bar on each file upload

- 🔒 CONTINUE BUTTON STAYS DISABLED until all required docs are uploaded

---

### 4. 🎥 VIDEO RECORDING SCREEN

- Now prompt:  
  “Record a short video to confirm this is your will and you are of sound mind.”
- Show:
  - Skyler or guide text: “Introduce yourself, state the date, and confirm the will is yours.”
  - Optional script shown on screen
  - Video recorder component with webcam permissions
  - Playback feature to review video
  - Option to re-record

---

### 5. ✍️ FINAL REVIEW & EDITING PAGE

- Show the full will in a clean, editable format
- Sidebar instructions: “You can make minor edits before finalizing.”
- Allow users to:
  - Edit text sections (contenteditable)
  - Fix names, grammar, dates, etc.
- Track unsaved changes

- CTA: “I’m Satisfied”

---

### 6. ✅ FINALIZE AND SAVE

- Final message from Skyler:  
  “We’ve completed your legacy journey. You can now finalize and store your will securely.”

- Button: “Finalize and Save”
- On click:
  - Save document to secure database
  - Show success animation
  - Confirmation screen: “Your will is now securely stored and ready.”

🧠 TECHNICAL STRUCTURE & FUNCTIONALITY:

- React + Tailwind CSS preferred
- Modular components for:
  - Template Grid
  - Chat bubble system
  - Auto-scrolling container
  - Document preview pane
  - File upload logic
  - Video recorder
  - Final review editor
- Smooth transitions between each screen (Framer Motion, ScrollTrigger)
- Mobile + tablet + desktop optimized
- Dark mode supported

🎨 DESIGN VIBE:
- Soft gradients, white glass UI, floating interface feel
- Use a blend of modern fonts (e.g., Inter for UI, EB Garamond for preview doc)
- Smooth rainbow or aurora background animation
- AI elements: Typing animation, Skyler avatar, subtle response delays

🏁 FINAL OUTPUT:
→ Full non-dashboard chat-based flow  
→ Includes: template selector → chat Q&A → live preview → doc upload → video recording → final edit → finalize  
→ All transitions, animations, scrolls, and validations working  
→ Responsive, secure, and cleanly structured

DO NOT break this flow. Make all logic reusable and components elegant. Deliver perfection.
