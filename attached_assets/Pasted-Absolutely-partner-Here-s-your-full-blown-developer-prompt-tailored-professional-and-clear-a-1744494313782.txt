Absolutely, partner! Here's your **full-blown developer prompt**‚Äîtailored, professional, and clear as crystal‚Äîfor the AI or dev working on your WillTank platform. It covers every critical point, including your **custom SMTP from Namecheap** for email delivery:

## ‚úÖ üîê FINAL IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT ‚Äî FOR WILLTANK EMAIL SYSTEM + 5-WAY DEATH VERIFICATION

---

### üîß **SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
We are rebuilding the entire **email-based notification, activation, and death verification** system on WillTank using a **custom SMTP setup from Namecheap**. The system must be secure, responsive, fast, and elegant without breaking any current features or designs.

---

### üì§ **1. Custom SMTP Email Setup**
We are using **Namecheap‚Äôs private SMTP settings** for all outgoing mail (activation, notification, alerts, check-ins, etc).  
Ensure the app supports **environment-based SMTP config**, and I will manually insert the credentials.

**Example setup to support:**

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.privateemail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=you@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=********
SMTP_FROM="WillTank Support <you@domain.com>"
```

**Use `nodemailer`** or any compatible package to send mail via this SMTP setup.

---

### ‚úâÔ∏è **2. Email Activation via OTP (For Signup)**
- On signup, send a **6-digit OTP** to the user‚Äôs email.
- OTP expires after 10 minutes.
- Include a **"Resend OTP"** button (limit to 3 retries).
- Upon successful verification, user is directed to **Onboarding ‚ûù Paywall ‚ûù Success Page ‚ûù Template Selection ‚ûù Will Creation.**

> ‚úÖ This should only happen once for new users. Logged-in users **must not see onboarding again.**

---

### üì£ **3. System Notification Emails**
Send email alerts to users for:
- Signup success / OTP
- Payment confirmation
- Will completed
- Video upload success
- Beneficiary added
- Executor added
- Email/password/account changes
- Death verification triggered

**Emails should be styled cleanly, mobile-friendly, and professional.**

---

### üß¨ **4. Beneficiary & Executor Invitations (with OTP)**
When a user adds:
- **Beneficiaries**
- **Executors**

Send each one an email with:
- The invitation details
- Their role explained
- A unique OTP to verify their identity
- A button to Accept / Decline the role
- Save their confirmation in the DB

> Only verified roles should count in the death protocol and view access.

---

### üîÅ **5. Weekly Check-In System**
- Every **7 days**, send check-in emails to:
  - User
  - Verified Beneficiaries
  - Executors
- Email has two buttons:
  - ‚úÖ ‚ÄúUser is alive‚Äù
  - ‚ùå ‚ÄúUser is dead‚Äù

If **ALL parties** mark the user as deceased, proceed to **trigger the Death Verification Workflow**.

---

### ‚ò†Ô∏è **6. Five-Way Death Verification System**
- User chooses 5 confidential contacts (beneficiaries/executors) for the **5-way unlock**.
- If death is reported, each contact receives:
  - A private link to the **View-Only Will Portal**
  - An individual OTP
- If **all 5 OTPs** are entered successfully **within a 10-minute window**, the portal grants access to:
  - Download the will
  - Attached documents
  - Video testimonies

Otherwise, only **view-only** access remains.

---

### üîê **7. View-Only Portal**
- Includes a read-only view of the completed will
- Show:
  - Title
  - Date created
  - Documents attached
  - Video testimony
- **No download button** unless all 5 OTPs are used successfully
- Show watermark and security notes to prevent screen grabs
- Log all portal views and attempts

---

### üì¶ **8. Packages/Tools to Use**
- `nodemailer` (SMTP email delivery)
- `uuid` or `short-unique-id` (for OTP and tokens)
- `bcrypt` (to hash and validate OTPs securely)
- `jsonwebtoken` (if auth tokens needed)
- `cron` or `node-cron` (for weekly check-in automation)
- `express-rate-limit` (limit OTP resend and access attempts)
- `zod` or `yup` (form validation if needed)
- `react-toastify` or `sonner` (for toast notifications)

### üö´ Important Notes
- **DO NOT BREAK existing UI or structure**
- Keep all current **design, fonts, responsiveness, animations**
- All components must remain **fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile**
- Test every flow on all device sizes and simulate slow network conditions
