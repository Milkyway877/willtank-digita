You are now responsible for fixing the entire video recording component on WillTank.

🚨 CURRENT STATUS:
- The "Enable Camera" button is frozen and does nothing.
- The "Skip Recording" button is dead.
- The Blob or recording implementation is either broken or missing.
- This is a CRITICAL BLOCKER.

🎯 MISSION:
Fully implement and fix the **video recording section** with these clear rules:

---

🎥 VIDEO RECORDING FLOW:

✅ 1. **Enable Camera Button**  
- When clicked, prompt the user for webcam permissions using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })`.
- If permission granted:
  - Stream live video into a `<video>` tag.
  - Show the buttons: “Start Recording” and “Skip Recording”.

🛑 If denied:
- Display a friendly error message: “Camera access denied. Please allow permissions or choose to skip.”

---

✅ 2. **Start Recording Button**
- Start capturing the video using `MediaRecorder`.
- Store the video chunks in an array.
- Change the button to: “Stop Recording”.

---

✅ 3. **Stop Recording Button**
- Stop the recorder and compile the chunks into a single `Blob`.
- Create a URL using `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` and display it in a `<video controls>` tag for preview.
- Upload the video blob if needed using `FormData`.

---

✅ 4. **Skip Recording Button**
- Should work immediately.
- If clicked, bypass the video section and take the user to the next section of the flow.
- Make sure this button is always functional even if the camera is unavailable.

---

✅ 5. **DO NOTS:**
- ❌ Do not leave any of these buttons frozen or unresponsive.
- ❌ Do not use placeholder videos or broken blob logic.
- ❌ Do not break design, styling, layout, or responsiveness.
- ❌ Do not loop the user back to onboarding or reset their flow.
- ❌ Do not create a new interface unless necessary.

---

🧠 DEV NOTES:
- Use `useEffect` in React to handle cleanup of video streams.
- Add a fallback message in case browser does not support `getUserMedia`.
- Check browser support using `!!navigator.mediaDevices`.

---

🔥 YOUR GOAL:
Make this video recording experience **bulletproof**, responsive, secure, and seamless for all devices and browsers that support webcam access.

THE USER **MUST** be able to:
- Open camera
- Record
- Stop
- Preview
- Upload
- OR Skip smoothly.

Fix this once and for all. No excuses.
