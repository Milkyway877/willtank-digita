### ✅ **Objective: Build an Intelligent, Interactive Will Creation System with Skyler**

---

### 🧠 SKYLER’S FUNCTIONAL ROLE

1. **Start Point**: Skyler activates right after the user completes onboarding.
2. **Persistent Presence**: Skyler stays in the bottom-right corner as a sleek, floating chatbot with a modern AI avatar.
3. **Knows Everything**: Feed Skyler all the context of WillTank:
   - Will creation steps and meanings.
   - Documents, beneficiaries, executors, assets, messages, check-ins.
   - Legal terminology and common will mistakes.

### 💡 INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE DURING WILL CREATION

1. **(i) Info Symbol on Each Question**:
   - When clicked, Skyler pops up and explains:
     - What the question means.
     - Suggestions or examples.
     - Legal tips or what to avoid.

2. **Smart Input Validation**:
   - Skyler automatically detects:
     - Misspellings (names, locations, etc.).
     - Incorrect phone/email formats.
     - Suspicious or vague inputs (e.g., “John Doe” with no relation).
   - Shows a gentle message:
     > “Hmm, did you mean *Jonathan Doe* instead of *Jonh Doe*?”
   - Displays 2 buttons:
     - ✅ **Fix**
     - ❌ **Continue as is**

3. **Required Fields for Every Individual Mentioned**:
   - Email (must be valid).
   - Phone number (with country code).
   - Location (city, state, country).
   - Relation to testator.

### 💻 DEVELOPMENT NOTES FOR AI IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Skyler Chat UI**:
   - Use a fixed position floating chat bubble.
   - Use TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for smooth popups and buttons.
   - When a user hovers or clicks (i), Skyler opens with contextual message.

2. **Validation & Suggestions**:
   - Hook into form inputs using controlled fields in React.
   - Use regex for email/phone.
   - For names and locations, integrate a simple spell-checker like `typo-js` or build a mini validator with Levenshtein distance.
   - Add `Fix / Continue` buttons with real-time updates to the form values.

3. **Skyler API Integration**:
   - Use `fetch` with the GPT-4o-Mini API key:
     ```js
     const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
       method: "POST",
       headers: {
         "Content-Type": "application/json",
         "Authorization": "Bearer sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         model: "gpt-4o",
         messages: [
           { role: "system", content: "You are Skyler, the AI assistant guiding users through will creation..." },
           { role: "user", content: "What is an executor and who should I choose?" }
         ],
       }),
     });
     ```

4. **Component Design**:
   - Info icon on each question opens a modal or inline popup.
   - Validation logic uses `useEffect` to trigger on input change.
   - Error messages are subtle and helpful, never aggressive.
