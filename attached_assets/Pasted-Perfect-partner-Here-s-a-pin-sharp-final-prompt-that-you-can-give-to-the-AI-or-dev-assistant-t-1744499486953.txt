Perfect, partner. Here's a **pin-sharp final prompt** that you can give to the AI or dev assistant to **implement a beautiful, functional, and responsive Dashboard Navbar and Sidebar system** without **breaking any current design or feature**. This is meant to **enhance**, not replace — and it’s optimized to work flawlessly on **all screen sizes** with **zero lag, freezing, or glitches**.

### 🔍 Add to the Top Right Corner of the Existing Navbar:
- **Search bar** (with magnifying glass icon inside input)
  - Placeholder: "Search your wills, assets..."
  - Small font, rounded, soft border, fits neatly
- **Notification bell icon**
  - Positioned next to search bar
  - Small badge when there’s a new notification
  - Smooth hover effect

   - Toggle button remains visible
   - Tooltips show on hover for icons

4. **When Expanded:**
