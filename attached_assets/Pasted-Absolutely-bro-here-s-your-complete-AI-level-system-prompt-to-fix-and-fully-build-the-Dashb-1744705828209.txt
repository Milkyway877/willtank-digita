Absolutely bro — here’s your **complete, AI-level system prompt** to **fix and fully build the Dashboard and Wills Page**, killing all the dummy data, placeholder junk, and replacing it with 100% live, clean, functional components connected to Supabase.

You can paste this into your AI dev assistant or code generator to get it building the **REAL, non-broken dashboard and will manager flow**.

## ⚒️ FULL SYSTEM FIX PROMPT — DASHBOARD + WILLS PAGE CLEANUP & FUNCTIONALITY

You are now tasked with **completely cleaning and functionalizing** the current **Dashboard page** and the **"My Will" page** (now renamed to `Wills`). The current UI is broken, filled with dummy content, non-working buttons, and fake placeholders. You are to fix and build this according to the following exact specifications:

---

### 🧼 DASHBOARD PAGE — CLEAN & FUNCTIONAL

#### 🔹 REMOVE:
- All dummy cards, text, placeholder widgets, non-functional charts or animations.
- Remove any hardcoded stats or references to sample data.

#### 🔹 ADD & FIX:
- Connect dashboard to Supabase to fetch and show:
  - Number of wills created by the user.
  - Total documents uploaded.
  - Status of video upload (✅ or ❌).
  - Date of last will update or creation.
  - User’s current subscription level (Starter, Gold, etc).

#### 🔹 QUICK ACTIONS (Fix or Build from Scratch):
- These buttons must actually work:
  - ✅ **“Wills”** → Navigates to `/wills` and lists all user wills.
  - ✅ **“Supporting Documents”** → Shows uploaded documents per will.
  - ✅ **“Video Testimony”** → Shows uploaded video for the current active will.

- Use Tailwind or minimal UI styles to make them visually sharp.
- Disable any of these buttons if the user hasn’t yet uploaded documents or completed that step.

#### 🔹 ADDITIONS:
- Notification area on top (e.g., `Welcome back, [First Name]! You last edited your will 4 days ago.`).
- If user has no wills yet, show a helpful card:  
  `"You haven’t created a will yet. Click here to start your first one → [Create New Will]"`

### 📂 "MY WILL" PAGE → RENAME TO "WILLS" PAGE

#### ✅ PAGE PATH: `/wills`

#### 🔹 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Pull and list all wills saved by the current user from Supabase.
- Each Will entry must include:
  - Will Name or Title
  - Date created
  - Status (Draft / Completed / Locked)
  - Button set:
    - ✏️ Edit
    - 🗑️ Delete (with confirm dialog)
    - 👁️ Preview (opens in modal or separate view)

#### 🔹 BUTTON: “Create New Will”
- Should be clearly visible top-right or floating bottom-right.
- Clicking it should redirect user to `/create-will` or re-initialize Skyler Q&A flow.

#### 🔹 DESIGN:
- Use a card or table layout to show wills.
- If no wills exist, show an illustration and CTA: `“No wills yet – Let’s create your first will →”`

### 🧠 BACKEND INTEGRATION WITH SUPABASE

You MUST do all of the following:

- Fetch wills from the `wills` table, filtered by current user ID.
- Fetch associated document and video statuses using relational queries or joins.
- If will has status `draft`, highlight it with a badge.
- Allow delete only if the will is not locked (status !== completed).
- Show toast notifications for edit, delete, and save actions.

---

### ⚙️ NOTES ON STRUCTURE & STABILITY

- DO NOT break authentication or routing.
- DO NOT allow users to see others’ wills or documents (enforce RLS).
- Store all files, videos, and will content in Supabase.
- Use `useEffect`, `useState`, and Supabase queries efficiently — no unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 💡 OPTIONAL (If time allows):
- Add a simple chart showing monthly will activity (if the user has >1 will).
- Add a button to “Download Will as PDF” under the Preview modal.
- Add soft delete with Supabase flags (`is_deleted`) instead of hard delete.

---

### ✅ SUMMARY CHECKLIST (MUST BE TRUE ONCE DONE)

- [ ] Dashboard shows only REAL data.
- [ ] All quick links on dashboard actually work.
- [ ] No placeholder, fake text or fake buttons remain.
- [ ] “My Will” page is renamed to “Wills” and shows real user wills.
- [ ] Edit/Delete/Preview/Create Will buttons all functional.
- [ ] Everything is saved/fetched through Supabase securely.
- [ ] Notifications, loading states, and empty states are cleanly designed.
