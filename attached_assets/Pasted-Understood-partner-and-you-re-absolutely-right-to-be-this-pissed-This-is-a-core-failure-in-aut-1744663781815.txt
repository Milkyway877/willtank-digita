Understood, partner ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to be this pissed. This is a **core failure in authentication flow** and **completely unacceptable** for a production platform like **WillTank**. So let's tell the AI **exactly what‚Äôs wrong** and what it needs to **fix immediately** ‚Äî no excuses, no bugs, no BS.

---

### üß®üî• Tell the Replit AI (or paste this in your dev terminal AI or Replit shell):

> üî¥ The platform is now live at **willtank.com**, but **authentication is completely broken**, and this is **unacceptable in production**. Here‚Äôs what is going wrong:
>
> **1. Email Sign-Up is Buggy:**
> - When a user enters their credentials and clicks Sign Up‚Ä¶
> - They are redirected to the **email verification screen**, BUT it only shows for **1 second** before auto-redirecting to the **Login page**.
> - This happens before they even enter the verification code from their email!
> - Then the Login screen fails because the user hasn‚Äôt verified their email yet. **Totally broken logic.**
>
> **2. Google OAuth is Even Worse:**
> - User selects their Google account to log in or sign up
> - After selection, they are taken to a **404 page** ‚Äî instead of being redirected to the dashboard or an appropriate callback route.
>
> **Fix this shit NOW.** This needs to be **production-grade**:
>
> ‚úÖ Proper email verification flow: show the email verification screen **until the user completes verification.**  
> ‚úÖ Correct Google OAuth redirect: after Google auth, redirect users to the **dashboard or /onboarding if first-time user**  
> ‚úÖ No 404s. No broken links. No redirects before auth is complete.  
> ‚úÖ Enable Clerk middleware properly. Use `ClerkProvider`, `RedirectToSignIn`, and `SignedIn/SignedOut` guards correctly.  
> ‚úÖ All routes must be protected and redirected correctly using `useAuth()` or `useUser()` properly.

### üì¶ Bonus Fix Notes (Use If You're a Dev Too):

If you‚Äôre coding this yourself or with help:

1. **Fix Clerk Redirects in Your `clerk.config.ts` (or your root config):**

```ts
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

<ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  navigate={(to) => router.push(to)}
  afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"
  afterSignUpUrl="/onboarding"
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  signUpUrl="/sign-up"
/>
```

2. **Use Middleware to Protect Routes (`middleware.ts`)**:

```ts
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/about", "/contact"],
  ignoredRoutes: ["/api/webhooks(.*)"],
  afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
    if (!auth.userId && !auth.isPublicRoute) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", req.url));
    }
  }
});
```

3. **Fix Your 404 Problem**  
Make sure you're not redirecting to `/404` due to missing route in Google callback. Set the right callback URLs in Clerk Dashboard:
- Add `https://willtank.com/*` and `https://willtank.com/sign-in-callback` or equivalent to your **Authorized Redirect URIs** under **OAuth**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Final Dev Checklist

- [ ] Email verification page **holds user in place** until they verify.
- [ ] **Google Sign-In** works and redirects properly.
- [ ] **No 404s after auth**.
- [ ] Clerk middleware properly installed and tested.
- [ ] Live version at `willtank.com` shows smooth auth, no errors.

Let‚Äôs fix this. You didn‚Äôt build WillTank to fumble the bag at the finish line. üíº  
Ready when you are to go full dev-mode and repair this cleanly ‚Äî I‚Äôve got your back all the way. Want me to help patch the actual code directly next?
