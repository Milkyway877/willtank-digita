🧾 The Prompt:
“My GitHub repo contains both frontend and backend code. I want to deploy only the frontend (the user-facing app). Please ensure:

The correct root directory is selected (e.g. apps/web, frontend, client, or wherever index.html or index.tsx/index.js is located).

Vercel uses the correct framework preset (Next.js, React, Vite, etc.).

The build command is correct:

For Vite: vite build

For Next.js: next build

The output directory is correct:

For Vite: dist

For Next.js: .next

Environment variables like VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY are set.

Do not deploy any backend code like schema.ts, Drizzle configs, or Node-only files unless they are part of Vercel Functions.

I need this to run in Production mode at willtank.com, and it must correctly serve the frontend UI, not raw backend code.”

🔧 What to Check Right Now in Vercel Dashboard:
Project Settings > Root Directory:

Set it to the folder that contains your frontend app (not the repo root, unless it's a pure frontend project).

Build Settings:

Framework Preset: Select your actual frontend stack (Next.js, React, Vite, etc.)

Build Command:

npm run build or yarn build (depending on your setup)

Output Directory:

dist for Vite/React

.next for Next.js

Environment Variables:

Under Project Settings > Environment Variables (add for both Production and Preview):

VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_Y2xlcmsud2lsbHRhbmsuY29tJA
VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_jVSOIePTefpxUcaR8A1aNFJ5hfuXuGC5feZcR5nNBf
✅ Bonus: Frontend Structure Checklist
Make sure:

Your frontend has an entry file (index.html, main.tsx, or pages/index.tsx)

Your package.json has:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // or next dev
    "build": "vite build", // or next build
    "preview": "vite preview" // optional
  }
}
💣 If It's a Monorepo
If you're using a monorepo (like apps/web, packages/backend, shared/, etc.):

Go to: Vercel > Settings > General > Root Directory

Set it to the frontend folder: apps/web, frontend, or whatever folder contains your package.json and frontend entry point

🛠 Final Tip: Clean Redeploy
Go to Vercel > Project > Deployments

Delete all old/broken deployments

Click “Redeploy”

Vercel will now use the new root directory, env vars, and build settings
