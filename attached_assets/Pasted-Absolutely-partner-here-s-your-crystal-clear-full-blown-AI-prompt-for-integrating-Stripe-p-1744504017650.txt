**üî• FULL STRIPE INTEGRATION PROMPT FOR WILLTANK üî•**

You are building a **fully functional Stripe payment integration** for WillTank, a next-gen AI-powered will creation platform. Follow these precise instructions:

---

### ‚úÖ USE STRIPE API (LIVE MODE)
- Wait for the user to input the actual **Stripe Secret Key** and **Publishable Key**.
- Use **Stripe Checkout** for smooth, secure payment flows.
- Alternatively, implement **Stripe Billing** for managing subscriptions inside the app if needed.

---

### üì¶ PLANS TO IMPLEMENT (USE THESE EXACT PRODUCT IDs):

| Plan Name   | Monthly | Yearly | Lifetime | Stripe Product ID            |
|-------------|---------|--------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Platinum    | $55     | $550   | $999     | `prod_S2537v7mpccHQI`        |
| Gold        | $29     | $290   | $599     | `prod_S252Aj8D5tFfXg`        |
| Starter     | $14.99  | $149.99| $299     | `prod_S251guGbh50tje`        |
| Enterprise  | Custom  | Custom | Custom   | Trigger `Contact Support` UI |

> üß† **NOTE:** Make sure the correct `price IDs` are also fetched or configured for each pricing interval when creating Checkout Sessions or billing.

### üéØ FUNCTIONAL GOALS:

1. **Pricing Page** with 4 options: Starter, Gold, Platinum, and Enterprise.
   - Monthly, Yearly, and Lifetime toggles.
   - Clicking a plan triggers a Stripe Checkout session.

2. **Post-payment redirect:**
   - Users land on a **‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù page** with animated confirmation and access to start or continue will creation.

3. **Subscription Data Sync:**
   - User metadata or Firestore/Supabase DB updated to reflect the chosen plan and billing cycle.
   - Lifetime plans should be one-time payments.
   - Monthly and yearly plans should support auto-renewal and cancellation.

4. **Billing Portal:**
   - Accessible via Dashboard > Billing.
   - Allow users to:
     - View plan
     - Update card
     - Cancel subscription
     - Upgrade or downgrade
     - View billing history

5. **Enterprise Plan Logic:**
   - Instead of Stripe Checkout, clicking Enterprise triggers a **Support Contact Modal** (email, form, or chat).
   - No automatic Stripe flow unless manually upgraded by admin.

6. **Plan-based Access Control:**
   - Users should see platform features based on plan level:
     - Starter: Basic Will creation only.
     - Gold: Adds multiple wills and advanced features.
     - Platinum: Full platform access.
     - Enterprise: Custom features + 24/7 support.

### ‚öôÔ∏è OPTIONAL FEATURES (IF TIME ALLOWS):

- Use `webhooks` to listen to events like:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
- Set up automated emails post-purchase using the existing custom SMTP.

---

### üé® DESIGN MUSTS:

- Modern pricing UI with animated toggles.
- Stripe-hosted checkout preferred for security and ease.
- Transitions and redirects must be **smooth and responsive**.
- Responsive layout ‚Äî fully mobile and desktop compatible.

---

### üö® DO NOT:

- Use test keys in production.
- Display dummy pricing ‚Äî use **real values and IDs**.
- Break any existing UI flow. Billing should integrate *seamlessly* with the onboarding system.

---

Once the API keys are entered, complete the setup and trigger a test checkout session to confirm everything is working.
